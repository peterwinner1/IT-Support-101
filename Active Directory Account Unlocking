Account Locks in ARS / Active Directory
Account being locked would cause users to be unable to sign into their devices, accounts, etc. 
IN ARS (Active Roles Server) this would mean that when you search their username it would show a orange lock icon
To unlock account, select the account, and their should be an option to unlock
Advise user to refresh application or get user to sign in again
Issue should be resolved however if issue reoccurs it could be an indicator of password sync failure
