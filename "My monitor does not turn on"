Monitor Hardware support ("My screen does not turn on but it did yesterday")
This is a common hardware issue in the IT world. 
Ask clarifying questions (Why, what, when, who, etc) 
Once that is established
Go through basic troubleshooting procedure
  Turn on and off
  Ensure cables are plugged in
  Ensure client is plugged into correct port on laptop
  Confirm that changes have not been made
If changes have not been made and all above have been tried and do not work, hard reset device
Unplug all cables to device
For lenovo laptops, use pin needle or small thin object to plug in button on back of laptop (should make a clicking noise or feeling)
For dell laptops, hold power button for atleast 15 seconds
After, turn on laptop and plug in cords
If monitor continues to not work, 
Delete drivers using registry and device manager (with cords unattached)
Replug cords in
Client should be able to use monitor like normal and if issue persist
Client needs to try another cable and or consult company for replacement monitor.
